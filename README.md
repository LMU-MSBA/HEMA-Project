### Project Description
We are working to better understand subscriber behavior to give us insights on customer churn and ways to prevent it from happening. We are helping service managers, marketing analysts, business strategists, and other leaders for the company to allow them to make better business decisions. We will utilize data visualization tools like Tableau to help us better understand customer demographics and behavior, then create a Machine Learning model to help predict customers who are likely to churn so that we can find ways to prevent that from happening. This project is inspired by a Disney Data Analyst job post that our group took an interest in. This job was about better understanding and improving Bundle growth and subscriber behavior for Disney's streaming services (Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+), however when it came to finding data for this topic, we were not able to find any. However, we found related data from a Telecom company that is focused on understanding subscriber behavior so we have decided to pivot our project to focus on this. The job post is saved as a PDF in this repository.
