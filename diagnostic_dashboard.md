- We currently do not have new data to update our results, but if we did, we would need to refresh the extract to get the latest information. We would go to the Data menu and select “Extract Data” > “Refresh” which would update our data extract with the latest information from our data source.



*Note: I used Tableau Public, but did not purchase a license so I was unable to use the data warehouse as the data source. Also, there was no place for me to use SQL to limit the data pulled into the visualization tool.*
