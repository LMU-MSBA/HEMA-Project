## Data governance policy

Quality: Data quality is critical in our data governance policy. We ensure that data is accurate, complete, and relevant to its intended purpose. This involves establishing clear standards and procedures for data collection, validation, and maintenance. Regular audits and quality checks are conducted to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or errors in the data. By maintaining high-quality data, we enhance decision-making processes and foster trust among stakeholders.

Security: Security is a cornerstone of our data governance framework to safeguard sensitive information and protect against unauthorized access, breaches, or data loss. This involves implementing robust security measures such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems. Regular risk assessments and audits are conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate security threats promptly. Our commitment to data security ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data assets.

Compliance: Compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards is a fundamental principle of our data governance policy. We adhere to data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, as well as industry-specific regulations. This involves establishing clear policies and procedures for data handling, storage, and sharing to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Regular training and awareness programs are provided to employees to promote adherence to compliance standards and mitigate risks of non-compliance.

Ethics: Ethical considerations guide our approach to data management and usage. We uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability in all aspects of data governance. This includes respecting individual privacy rights, obtaining informed consent for data collection and processing, and avoiding discriminatory practices. We are committed to using data responsibly and ethically, taking into account the potential impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Regular ethical reviews and assessments are conducted to ensure alignment with our ethical principles and values.

By prioritizing quality, security, compliance, and ethics in our data governance policy, we establish a framework for responsible data management and usage. These principles serve as a foundation for building trust, promoting innovation, and maximizing the value of data assets while minimizing risks and ensuring regulatory compliance.
